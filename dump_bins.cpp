/*
 *
 * Temporally bins a photon stream
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bin_photons [BIN_LENGTH]
 *
 * Where BIN_LENGTH is the length of each bin in counter units.
 *
 * Input:
 *   A binary photon stream
 *
 * Output:
 *   A list of records in the following format:
 *   [CHAN]     [BIN_START_TIME]        [BIN_PHOTON_COUNT]	[LOST_COUNT]
 *
 * Notes:
 *   We handle wrap-around here by simply keeping all times as 64-bit and
 *   assume that we wrap-around at most once.  With 1 nanosecond clock units,
 *   this gives us 500 years of acquisition time.
