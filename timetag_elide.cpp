 * This tool elides delta events that don't bracket a strobe event, greatly reducing
 * file sizes in ALEX-type experiments without loss of information.
 * 
 * In particular, we first keep the first 1000 delta events to ensure
 * that the excitation periods can be properly recovered during
 * analysis. After this initial period, we only keep delta events that
 * come before or after a strobe event.
